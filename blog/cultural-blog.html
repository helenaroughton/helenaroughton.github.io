      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          EQ is the ability to recognise, understand, and control one's own
          emotions and reactions while also being able to recognise and
          acknowledge other peoples emotions and feelings. Some people may be
          good at recognising their own emotions and being able to respond
          accordingly but not good at recognising or acknowledging other
          peoples. Having high EQ is being able to do both, and crucially
          acknowledging feelings i.e. empathising with others, not just
          recognising them. EQ is also about one's ability to build strong
          interpersonal relationships.

      <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">How is EQ different to IQ?<br /></h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          EQ differs from IQ as it can't be objectively measured in a
          standardised way the same way that IQ can. IQ assesses a person's
          logical reasoning and cognitive ability, whereas, EQ is someone's
          aptitude for recognising and understanding own and others' emotions.
          Someone may have very high IQ but may lash out others, turn to
          addiction, or feel disconnected from the world around them - having a
          higher EQ would mitigate this, particularly in relation to being able
          to manage one's own emotions.

      <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">Why is EQ important?<br /></h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          EQ is important because it is the cornerstone to building healthy and
          long-lasting relationships with those around them and to feeling
          connected with yourself. EQ can be developed so having a low EQ isn't
          the end of the world, but without working on it, lower EQ (paired with
          higher IQ) can result in strained relationships, poor job performance,
          and low mental and physical health due to the inability to manage your
          own emotions and inability to empathise with others. In the work
          place, a higher EQ is essential for team collaboration, giving and
          receiving constructive feedback, and as a leader for building a
          healthy work culture and environment.
