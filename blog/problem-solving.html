          During the FlipFlop problem, which was split into parts, I became
          stuck for a long time on the first part of the problem. I had already
          used pseudocode to type/plan out what I needed to do so didn't feel as
          though redoing this would help. I understood what I needed to do but
          didn't know how to get there, I spoke aloud, I used google search to
          try find examples of how to use the statements/arguments/tools I
          wanted to use, but no matter what I tried I wasn't getting anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          The test errors also weren't really helping me as they kept changing
          (but not resolving) each time I changed something. I eventually
          remembered that someone else might have posted in the discord
          foundations help channel, so I checked this and saw someone had even
          asked about the same question! Instantly upon checking their question
          and facilitator corresponding answers, I knew what I was doing wrong.
          I was trying to incorporate both parts into the first part, and in
          doing so, completely overcomplicating the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt very frustrated before checking discord as I felt as though I
          was going around in circles. The test was outputting what I needed it
          to with console.log but the other test errors weren't making much
          sense in relation to the rest or helping me work out what I was doing
          wrong. I changed so many different things and never got closer and
          this never-ending cycle was really challenging to deal with. I was
          getting super frustrated with myself and the situation. When I finally
          realised it was because I had overcomplicated it, I was both super
          relieved, but also disappointed in myself for not realising that
          sooner or being able to understand that the question was simpler than
          I thought. I learned that more often than not, the answer is simpler
          than I think.

          I quite enjoyed the final problem - deBee. I felt as though the soon
          as I read the exercise I knew what I needed to do and so wrote this
          out quickly in pseudocode to get it out of my head before I lost it. I
          was a bit unsure which method I wanted to use but was more comfortable
          with one so went with that. While trying to code it I still
          encountered some problems like not realising that converting all
          characters to lowercase doesn't action it on the original, which when
          I found this out, simplified my task. I googled the types of methods
          trying to find examples of when they were used, and also used an LLM
          to break down the methods in more detail or to explain what some of
          the error messages meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt a mixture of self accomplishment in being able to achieve big
          parts of the exercise and know what I wanted to do but also confusion
          when some things didn't work as I expected them to. I learned to not
          forget to think through the full circle of the exercise. I had
          forgotten to join the values back into a string from an array and was
          very confused why it wasn't working but this was the final last step
          to bring it back full circle.

        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes<br />
      </h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          Pseudocode: If I have an idea of where to start and what methods to
          use, I like this as a tool to get it out of my head and be able to
          come back to. But sometimes I didn't even know where to start to even
          use the pseudocode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying something: This is a go to for me but it was hard or
          frustrating when you're not even sure if it's close to the right track
          and whether you're only wrong with syntax or entirely wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rubber ducky method: I only used this a couple of times and more
          speaking to myself a couple of the steps rather than the full end to
          end process so I should try this more going forwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading error messages: Some of these were easier to read than others
          and by the end of the exercises, I had started to recognise some of
          the same types of error messages so got a little better at
          understanding them. Ultimately, though, I'm not very confident with
          reading these.
        </p>
        <p>
          Console.logging: Not confident, every time I try to use console.log it
          doesn't seem to work. It only worked once for me. I'm not confident
          when to use, where to enter it, or what to put after it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Googling: A big go to - especially codefreecamp, W3Schools, MDN, and
          Stackoverflow! Quite confident with researching terms and methods and
          trying to find examples of other people doing something similar to me.
          I'm not so confident reading the answers on forums and understanding
          what they're saying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asking your peers for help: Fine with it! Just haven't had the easiest
          opportunities to do that while based in UK. The weekly calls have been
          great for this though.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asking coaches for help: Similar with above, the timing isn't the best
          and if it's midday mid problem, it's not always the best solution for
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving your process with reflection: I feel as though I've noticed
          some improvements in learning through reflection, I think it
          solidifies a second time a certain technique you've learnt, which
          becomes easier to draw upon in future. I would like to keep doing the
          reflections
        </p>

      <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time? <br />

          I was reluctant to ask for help when I was battling with styling and
          positions/padding/margins in the second week. I was being stubborn and
          felt as though struggling with something that early on was
          embarrassing for me. I so also think the biggest reluctance, which
          unfortunately is still the case, is the different time zones as help
          may come 6-12 hours later and by then I'm often so tired it's hard to
          absorb much more and so it becomes a big barrier. I did, however, ask
          a question in the next week's homegroup about positioning and it was
          super helpful! I think for future, I'll ask for help anyway as it will
          still help no matter when I get it even if I no longer need it in that
          specific moment.
