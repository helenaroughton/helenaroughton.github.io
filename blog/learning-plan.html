      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          Ultimately I hope to add something positive to the world and do some
          good with the skills I gain from Dev Academy. What this looks like
          specifically I don't know for certain but currently lean towards
          becoming a software engineer within renewable energy or a health tech
          company or a technical product owner/manager. My biggest goal and
          focus is to feel proud of the work I do and know that it contributes
          to something bigger that aligns with my values in trying to help
          others and society.
        </p>
        <p>
          While at Dev Academy I would like to develop my skills in giving and
          receiving constructive feedback and speaking in front of larger groups
          as well as being able to represent myself and my ideas with
          confidence. I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be the
          pace of the content for 9 weeks and staying on top of it enough that I
          feel confident enough to speak in front of the group.

      <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">Bootcamp<br /></h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          In order to accomplish these goals, I expect to bring my best possible
          self to bootcamp. I will ensure I am available during the expected
          hours and that any tasks that have been set to me are completed by the
          agreed timeframes. In order to meet this, if I get stuck and am
          struggling, I'll make sure to ask for help from peers or facilitators
          so that any tasks that people have expected me to complete are
          finished in time. I think depending on the challenge or issue I have,
          I'll set myself a 10 min or 30 min timer and if I haven't solved it
          within that timeframe I'll ask for help. With this in mind I also hope
          that the facilitators will treat everyone the same with kindness and
          respect and are able to understand well the question being asked and
          able to articulate or explain the answer in a way that is easy to
          understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back to my strengths and limitations I noted during sprint 2,
          I think those held up pretty true and haven't changed too much. I did
          notice that what I thought would be the most distracting
          (messages/emails) wasn't as bad as I thought - the pomodorro technique
          has really helped me with this and in focusing as I tell myself it's
          just 25 minutes. I surprised myself that even amongst high stress
          levels with a lot going on, that when I sat down to complete study I
          was able to focus entirely on what needed to be done which is a
          strength I hadn't realised as much before.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping these ideas and strengths will carry through to bootcamp
          and so anticipate my strengths going forwards to be my motivation and
          ability to cope under stress. I think my biggest limitations will be
          not prioritising my wellbeing plan as I have noticed particularly,
          that exercise and other hauora activities are the first to go out the
          window when I am stressed and have a lot on. I also noticed, however,
          that when I gave myself proper rest breaks, including outside time, my
          brain worked better, and I fixed/understood things better so I'll also
          ensure I prioritise this so my cognitive function is at its best
          possible.

        What is your long term goal or career pathway?<br />
      </h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          While I'm still figuring some things out, I know I ultimately would
          love to end up working as a software engineer for a renewable energy
          company or a health tech company. I love to problem solve and for a
          long time I've aspired to do something good for the world and
          contribute to making the world a better place. I hope to build things
          to make this happen.

        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to

      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          I'm curious and I tend to pick things up quickly and a lot of this
          comes from wanting to know the why behind what I'm learning. I think
          wanting to know the why is a good motivator for learning, however,
          sometimes I've noticed I need to trust the process and if it feels as
          though there is a piece of information missing, the gap is generally
          filled in the following task or week.
        </p>
        <p>
          I definitely get easily distracted by messages/emails, admin to
          organise, and other people. This has been particularly hard these last
          two weeks as amongst studying, I'm relocating back to NZ in the last
          week of Foundations, and I anticipate my stress/distraction levels
          increasing. I am also determined and organised, and I hope these
          strengths will override any moments of distraction.

        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?<br />
      </h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          Confidence levels and patience could do with a boost! I get easily
          demolarised if I don't understand something right away and it becomes
          super easy to compare yourself to others but it's always good to
          remind yourself that everyone is on their own journey.

      <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">Collaboration & Workload<br /></h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          During foundations, I plan to front-load my week so that when I need
          help, there is more time to get help from facilitators while being in
          a different time-zone, and also to be able to participate/collaborate
          with others in my homegroup better. For bootcamp, I will have moved
          back to NZ to complete this, and so this course is my number one
          priority and commitment. I also understand other people within
          learning and teaching environments will have different commitments and
          things on, so communication with others is key.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also liked the use of the toggl timer and pomodoro method to
          track how long I spend on tasks and to ensure I give myself breaks
          even when I don't think I need one. As the course ramps up more I will
          continue to ensure I take good breaks, and step away from the
          computer, going for a walk always helps me clear my head and I come
          back able to tackle the task more productively. I will use the
          foundations help desk channel or private message to seek help if I
          haven't been able to solve the problem quickly myself. While in
          different time zones, I will move to the next task until I'm able to
          get help with the one I'm stuck on.

        <p>
          Kindness, respect, and patience when we come to them for help and when
          they're helping us with a problem. I hadn't thought too much about
          expectations but when I think back to times when teachers have been
          the most helpful it's when they're able to show the three things
          mentioned above, and a good understanding of the problem and ability
          to articulate the solution/answer.

          During week 6 of foundations I'll be travelling from the UK to NZ. My
          flight leaves London, Monday 29th September 10pm (UK time), and I
          arrive in Nelson, Wednesday 1 October 10pm (NZ time) so will be
          largely unavailable those days. At some stage, I'll be living with my
          brother, his partner, and daughter who is 2.5 years old, so I may
          occasionally need to look after her, but I don't anticipate this to be
          super disruptive.
