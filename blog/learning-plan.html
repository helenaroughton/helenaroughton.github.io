        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">What is your long term goal or career pathway?<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>While I'm still figuring some things out, I know I ultimately would love to end up working as a software engineer for a renewable energy company or a health tech company. I love to problem solve and for a long time I've aspired to do something good for the world and contribute to making the world a better place. I hope to build things to make this happen.

        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
            <p>I'm curious and I tend to pick things up quickly and a lot of this comes from wanting to know the why behind what I'm learning. I think wanting to know the why is a good motivator for learning, however, sometimes I've noticed I need to trust the process and if it feels as though there is a piece of information missing, the gap is generally filled in the following task or week.
            </p>
            <p>I definitely get easily distracted by messages/emails, admin to organise, and other people. This has been particularly hard these last two weeks as amongst studying, I'm relocating back to NZ in the last week of Foundations, and I anticipate my stress/distraction levels increasing. I am also determined and organised, and I hope these strengths will override any moments of distraction.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>Confidence levels and patience could do with a boost! I get easily demolarised if I don't understand something right away and it becomes super easy to compare yourself to others but it's always good to remind yourself that everyone is on their own journey.</p>
        </section>
        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">Collaboration & Workload<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>During foundations, I plan to front-load my week so that when I need help, there is more time to get help from facilitators while being in a different time-zone, and also to be able to participate/collaborate with others in my homegroup better. For bootcamp, I will have moved back to NZ to complete this, and so this course is my number one priority and commitment. I also understand other people within learning and teaching environments will have different commitments and things on, so communication with others is key.</P>
          <P>I have also liked the use of the toggl timer and pomodoro method to track how long I spend on tasks and to ensure I give myself breaks even when I don't think I need one. As the course ramps up more I will continue to ensure I take good breaks, and step away from the computer, going for a walk always helps me clear my head and I come back able to tackle the task more productively.
          I will use the foundations help desk channel or private message to seek help if I haven't been able to solve the problem quickly myself. While in different time zones, I will move to the next task until I'm able to get help with the one I'm stuck on.</P>

        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>Kindness, respect, and patience when we come to them for help and when they're helping us with a problem. I hadn't thought too much about expectations but when I think back to times when teachers have been the most helpful it's when they're able to show the three things mentioned above, and a good understanding of the problem and ability to articulate the solution/answer.</p>
        </section>
        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>During week 6 of foundations I'll be travelling from the UK to NZ. My flight leaves London, Monday 29th September 10pm (UK time), and I arrive in Nelson, Wednesday 1 October 10pm (NZ time) so will be largely unavailable those days. At some stage, I'll be living with my brother, his partner, and daughter who is 2.5 years old, so I may occasionally need to look after her, but I don't anticipate this to be super disruptive.</p>
