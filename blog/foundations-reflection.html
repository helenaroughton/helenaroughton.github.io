        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?<br />

          <li>
            I have learnt that the way other people who know me and love me see
            me confirms how I generally see myself but also is an enhanced
            version of how I see myself.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learnt that I like the practical side of human skills the
            most - i.e. I like learning about the techniques to think like a
            programmer, I like the idea of displaying ability to grow confidence
            (rather than just believing in yourself to grow confidence), I liked
            the focus on hauora, and I like the fact that if I prioritise
            playing strategy based games this can only benefit me and increase
            my neuroplasticity.
          </li>
          <li>
            I learnt that I struggle with prioritising mindfulness even if I
            want to try. I tried it twice and faced an obstacle with the app and
            never went back to it again so I think for the rest of the course I
            will find another way to incorporate this into my day.

        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?<br />
      </h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          One of the biggest roles these play would be in team work and
          collaboration and knowing how to communicate effectively. All three
          play a big part in how you communicate as a person and how you're able
          to engage with other people around you. Secondly (but not any less
          important) is also how you're able to look after yourself and hauora.
          I think as an addition, they also drive why you want to become a
          programmer and eventually the kind of learning and programming you
          want to do.

        What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?<br />
      </h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          I think what surprised me the most is feeling mixed about some of the
          human skills learning. I am supportive of human skills learning as
          really see the benefit of learning and understanding yourself and
          others etc. I really enjoyed parts of it but I think there are aspects
          for me where I felt it was too basic and didn't add anything new for
          me on what I already do as a person i.e. good listening/being aware of
          emotions and others etc. Learning about the neuroplasticity and growth
          mindset was really great as this went beyond and what I got the most
          from.

        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?<br />
      </h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          Learning and completing exercises on things I know/do when it took
          time away from other things.

        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
        course?<br />
      </h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          It is important! No matter how good a person may be technically, if
          they can't work with others, it's going to be hard in the work place,
          and it's so important to be able to display you can collaborate with
          others as all jobs involve this. I think in technical jobs it can also
          be easy to get bogged down in details and forget to see the bigger
          picture so it's important to be able to recognise this and also be
          receptive/good at communicating if someone else recognises this.

        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.<br />
      </h2>
      <section class="blog-article">
        <p>
          Despite my answers to some of the above questions, no I don't feel it
          was a waste of time. It's so important, it was a reprieve at times, I
          think the reflections were insanely beneficial, and I really like
          practical stuff - thinking like a programmer, and the inclusion of
          developing a learning plan and te whare tapa wha. Some of those last
          things are probably things I would have liked to do for myself anyway
          but maybe felt as though I wouldn't have had time so it was amazing to
          have this as part of the study. At times I definitely would have liked
          to use the time to do programming instead but overall definitely not a
          waste.
