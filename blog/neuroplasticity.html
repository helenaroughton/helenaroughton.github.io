        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">Neuroplasticity Principles<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>There have been studies that indicate that just knowing you can improve your intelligence through practice instantly puts people into a healthier mindset for learning as well as knowing the added context for why practicing (building stronger neural connections) also improves performance. 
          </p>
          <p>I like games and puzzles and used to do these a lot more as child so I would like to prioritise more of this in my life to cement certain ways of thinking and problem solving.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">Increasing Neuroplasticity<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
            <p>Play strategy based games, solve puzzles, practice. Mindfulness, healthy food, and quality sleep are also very important!!</p>
            <p>I liked <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/neuroplasticity-train-your-brain">this Atlassian article</a>for detailed techniques from Jonathan Thompson for how to increase your neuroplasticity and why it works. I also loved number 2. Take Naps, as even though I vaguely knew the benefits of a nap, it's always validating to be told a 20 min nap scientifically does make a big difference when you're falling asleep at your desk and then the nap does sort you right out! Don't tell my ex-bosses..... ha!</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">Growth Mindset<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>Having a growth mindset is the idea that you can change/improve your ways of thinking/intelligence, and that none of this is fixed. This is particularly relevant because as Carol Dweck noted, in today's ways of teaching and working, we prioritise passing and top grades rather than learning and learning how to learn. It's the classic adage of giving the man the fish or giving the man a rod and teaching him to catch the fish himself.

        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">Growth Mindset Surprises?<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>I have definitely seen the Carol Dweck video once or twice so it wasn't new or surprising for me but it's a good reminder to build the growth mindset habits that last. I really liked the <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/the-habits-of-successful-people-they-have-a-growth-mindset/">article by James Clear</a> on the habits of successful people and the example he gave from his high school coach about displaying ability which naturally will increase your confidence rather than just believing in yourself first. I like the practical approach this follows which is perhaps something I can implement better.</p></section>
        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">Implementing Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset to my Learning Journey<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>I think the best way for me to blend the growth mindset in to my learning plan, is to continue to keep going, to not be afraid to ask for help, and to challenge myself on stretch challenges even if I think I can't do it. I also regularly like to go on to the NY times app and play the games on there so I want to continue to do this/prioritise it as a break from the course but also a way to increase my neuroplasticity.</p></section>
