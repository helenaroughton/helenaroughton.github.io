        <h2 class="blog-post-sub-title">My Values and Some Stories<br /></h2>
        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>
            Growing up I had values I feel as though have always been there;
            helping others, equality/equity, strong sense of justice, loyalty,
            and care for the world around me. I can only attribute this to my
            parents and how they instilled this in me at a young age by
            embodying the values themselves and demonstrating the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            My relationship with my grandad was also very special and taught me
            a lot about loving and respecting other people who are different to
            you. We had quite different political viewpoints but mostly shared
            similar values and we could have great conversations and discussions
            about things we disagreed on without it ever getting to a point of
            anger or disrespect. Even after he died, the relationship I had with
            him has grounded me in how I can relate to people who are very
            different to me or have different viewpoints.
          </p>

          <p>
            My boss in my first big job taught me after I came to him with a
            mistake I had made that "there are no mistakes; only learnings"
          </p>
          <p>
            Even at the age of 8, I was the oldest female in our wider family
            friend group so it naturally fell on me to be a leader, babysitter,
            and mediator as we grew up. If other kids in the group got into
            spats, the parents came to me for what went down. If we all went off
            exploring, the parents put me in charge of being responsible. I
            think this instilled in me at a very early age the need to look out
            for others and be aware of other peoples feelings, and to want to
            help.

        <section class="blog-article">
          <p>
            This year I quit a job that wasn't fufilling me and decided to walk
            the Camino de Santiago de Compestela in Spain. 780km over 31 days
            and I was not only proud of myself for accomplishing the walk but
            proud of myself for what I got out of the walk. Some days were hard
            physically and some days were hard mentally and getting through each
            of those moments was a reminder of my resilience and determination.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also hoped to learn to be more present and to enjoy the smaller
            things in life. I definitely embraced this on the Camino but I'm
            still working on this today. When I find myself stressed, anxious,
            or wishing away time, I stop to remind myself to enjoy the sunshine
            on my face, the delicious coffee I'm drinking, or the moment with a
            friend, and sometimes this helps. But it's still a work in progress.

        <section class="blog-article">
            <p>"It feels near impossible to sum up my best friend of more than 25 years in just a few sentences, however, if I could, I would try to illustrate the interesting blend of logic and lust for life that makes Helena who she is. For she is logical, reliable, stubborn, determined, and has a notable aptitude for data, spreadsheets and problem solving. But waiting in the wings is also a spontaneous, adventurous, adrenaline junky alter ego, that is always ready for a new challenge or looking for the best ways to experience the joys of life. But above all that, she is also one of the kindest people I know, with a never ending love for the people she cares about, as well as an admirable drive and passion to do some good for this world."</p>
            <p>
           "Strong sense of social justice, problem
      solver, great positive energy, very quick learner"
            </p>
            <p>
           "Caring/kind/loving
      person always looking out for others feelings, motivated & passionate and
      a lot more"
            </p>
            <p>
           "You have a care and concern for the environment and people
      well being. You have strengths in both technical, languages, and emotional
      understanding. You keep busy with many achievements."
            </p>
            <p>
           "Helena is kind, compassionate and has a wicked sense of humour.
      She is extremely hardworking and diligent at any task she sets her mind
      to. This is seen in both professional and personal life. Like walking the
      Camino trail earlier this year and continuously pushing herself to grow in
      her career. In her friendships she is extremely loyal and reliable. She is
      both someone to laugh and cry with and is an excellent person to have by
      your side in life."
