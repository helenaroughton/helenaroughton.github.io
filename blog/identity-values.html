      Whakataukī E koekoe te kōkō, e ketekete te kākā, e kūkū te kererū – The
      parson bird chatters, the parrot gabbles, the wood pigeon coos Kei tēnā
      manu, kei tēnā manu tōna tangi ake. I tino mōhio ngā tūpuna Māori ki tēnei
      tūāhuatanga. I whakaritea e rātou tēnei tūāhuatanga o ngā manu ki te
      tangata e whakaaraara ai i a rātou anō ki te motuhaketanga o tēnā tangata,
      o tēnā tangata kia whakatairanga ake i ia pūmanawa o ia tangata. I mōhio
      hoki rātou mā te kāinga katoa te tamaiti e whakatipu. Hei tā rātou anō
      ahakoa te momo tangata; tangata wairangi, tangata pōrangi, tangata
      hārangi, tangata kaha, tangata koi, tangata aha, tangata aha he taonga
      tonu ia. The early ancestors recognised that, like humans, every bird has
      its own unique characteristics, like the individual cry they make. The
      native birds of Aotearoa have distinct calls and in some cases are named
      after those calls. This whakataukī alludes to the idea that like the
      native bird species we as humans also have individualistic traits. The
      literal lesson given by this proverb is two-fold: a- it takes all sorts to
      make a world b- variety is the spice of life. Whatungarongaro te tangata
      toitū te whenua As man disappears from sight, the land remains This
      demonstrates the holistic values of the Maori, and the utmost respect of
      Papatuanuku, the mother of the earth.

      This year I quit a job that wasn't fufilling me and decided to walk the
      Camino de Santiago de Compestela in Spain. 780km over 31 days and I was
      not only proud of myself for accomplishing the walk but proud of myself
      for what I got out of the walk. Some days were hard physically and some
      days were hard mentally and getting through each of those moments was a
      reminder of my resilience and determination. I also hoped to learn to be
      more present and to enjoy the smaller things in life. I definitely
      embraced this on the Camino but I'm still working on this today. When I
      find myself stressed, anxious, or wishing away time, I stop to remind
      myself to enjoy the sunshine on my face, the delicious coffee I'm
      drinking, or the moment with a friend, and sometimes this helps. But it's
      still a work in progress.

      Values and Stories My boss in my first big job taught me after I came to
      him with a mistake I had made that "there are no mistakes; only learnings"
      Even at the age of 8, I was the oldest female in our wider family friend
      group so it naturally fell on me to be a leader, babysitter, and mediator
      as we grew up. If other kids in the group got into spats, the parents came
      to me for what went down. If we all went off exploring, the parents put me
      in charge of being responsible. I think this instilled in me at a very
      early age the need to look out for others and be aware of other peoples
      feelings, and to want to help.

      Growing up I had values I feel as though have always been there; helping
      others, equality/equity, strong sense of justice, loyalty, and care for
      the world around me. I can only attribute this to my parents and how they
      instilled this in me at a young age by embodying the values themselves and
      demonstrating the same. My relationship with my grandad was also very
      special and taught me a lot about loving and respecting other people who
      are different to you. We had quite different political viewpoints but
      mostly shared similar values and we could have great conversations and
      discussions about things we disagreed on without it ever getting to a
      point of anger or disrespect. Even after he died, the relationship I had
      with him has grounded me in how I can relate to people who are very
      different to me or have different viewpoints. While thinking this all
      through I had a sudden overwhelm of love and appreciation for the people
      in my life who have supported me in getting to this stage. The decision to
      quit a well paid job and then a few months later uproot my life of 3 years
      in London to come home and do a course in coding in the hopes of a career
      change was and still is terrifying. My friends and family were monumental
      in helping me make the decision, especially as I needed to make it in 3
      days. I now look back at a that moment and feel lucky I've been able to
      surround myself with people who care about my wellbeing so much and who's
      values and opinions I trust so much, and how they shape me.

      At a younger age, I had a friend confide in me a lot about her feelings
      and views of herself and the world. It was quite clear to me she was
      depressed and I became increasingly worried about her and her safety. She
      had asked me not to tell anyone and to keep it confidential. She had
      iterated quite strongly this was important to her. We were school age and
      I wasn't a professional. I was very torn between seeking help and breaking
      her trust. Ultimately I decided to tell my mum and a teacher I trusted and
      the school got involved very quickly. I made the decision to break her
      trust and it affected our friendship for years, if not forever, but I
      don't regret it.
